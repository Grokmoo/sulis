description: |
  Bards are traveling poets and musicians who make use of a long and storied magical tradition.  Bards are able to learn several different songs, each one with different base magical effects.  Each song can be enhanced or modified by adding verses.  In addition, different melodies and rhythms can be introduced to create a variety of effects.  As new variations are added, the song takes more and more of the bard's attention, so a balance must be made if the bard wants to take other actions in combat.
  
  While reciting a basic song can be done at any time, Bards rely on a limited pool of inspiration in order to come up with new and exciting variations, maximizing their songs' overall effectiveness.
  
  Bards rely on their [c=f00|Perception] for their songs and supporting abilities.
