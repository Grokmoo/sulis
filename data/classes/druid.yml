  Druids practice an instinctive, natural magical tradition rooted in the wild, untamed places of Eao.  Druids think of their magic as forming the branches of a tree, with the different branches constantly in flux.  They can call upon wild creatures to aid them, and employ powerful transformations to enhance themselves and their allies.
  
  They are less limited than Mages in when they can cast their spells, but do not have the same wide range of effects.
  
  Druids use their [c=f00|Wisdom] for spell casting.
