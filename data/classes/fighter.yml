description: |
  Fighters are experts in all forms of martial combat, and, as they gain experience, frequently masters in more than one.  They have solid training in a large variety of weapons and equipment.  This includes both ranged and melee combat styles.
  
  On the battlefield, they can both protect more fragile comrades as well as leap into the fray themselves.
  
  Melee-focused fighters will rely heavily on their [c=f00|Strength], while ranged-focused fighters will make more use of [c=f00|Dexterity].
