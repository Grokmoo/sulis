description: |
  Rogues have a variety of skills both in and out of combat, making them a valuable addition to any party.  Typically they are poorly suited to head to head front line fighting.  Instead, they prefer to make devastating flanking attacks from the shadows, waiting for the perfect moment before unleashing a devastating strike with surgical precision.  Many also make use of a variety of traps.
  
  Rogues function best in concert with another warrior to distract opponents.  They have many abilities geared at debilitating or doing massive damage to tough individual opponents.
  
  Rogues rely heavily on their [c=f00|Dexterity] in combat.

      Striking from the shadows when least expected, Assassins can bring down the most dangerous targets in seconds, ideally giving their prey no time to react.  They can be quickly brought down themselves, though, if caught out in the open.
