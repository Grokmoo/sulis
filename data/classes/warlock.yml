description: |
  Warlocks are powerful magic users who have developed their skills under the tutelage of isolated masters or largely on their own.  They do not possess the rigor or pure skill of the Mage, but are also not limited by structures such as the Circles of Magic.  Warlocks gain access to a variety of spells, but focus mostly on hexes, charms, and illusions.
  
  Their spell casting is only limited by their own internal pool of power which improves as they gain experience.  They can cast any spell at will as long as they have the available Power.
  
  A warlock's spell casting is influenced by their [c=f00|Intellect].
