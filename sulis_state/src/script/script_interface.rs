/// The ScriptInterface, accessible in all Lua scripts as the global `game`.
/// The following methods are available on this object (documentation WIP):
///
/// # `current_round() -> Int`
/// Returns the current round, or the total number of rounds of playtime that have elapsed.
/// This number increases by 1 for every complete round of combat, or by 1 for every 5 seconds
/// of out of combat play.
///
/// # `add_time(days: Int, hours: Int (Optional), rounds: Int (Optional))`
/// Adds the specified days, hours, and rounds to the current time.
///
/// # `current_time() -> Table`
/// Returns a table containing the current time.
/// Table entries are `day`, `hour`, and `round`.
///
/// # `party() -> Table<ScriptEntity>`
/// Returns a table containing all current party members.
///
/// # `entity_with_id(id: String) -> Table<ScriptEntity>`
/// Returns a `ScriptEntity` object for the entity with the given unique
/// id, if such an entity can be found.  Otherwise, returns the invalid `ScriptEntity`.  The ID is
/// the unique id associated with the individual entity, which is typically the same as the actor
/// ID for actors that are only used once, and is generated for encounter created actors.
/// ## Examples
/// ```lua
///   entity = game:entity_with_id("id1")
///   if not entity:is_valid() return end
///   game:log("Found entity with name " .. entity:name())
///```
///
/// # `entities_with_ids(ids: Table) -> ScriptEntity`
/// Returns a list of `ScriptEntity` objects for each of the specified
/// ids that are found.  The list may be empty.  Also see `entity_with_id(id)`.
/// ## Examples
/// ```lua
///  entities = game:entities_with_ids({"id1", "id2"})
///  for i = 1, #entities do
///    game:log("Found entity with name " .. entities[i]:name())
///  end
/// ```
///
///# `activate_targeter()`
/// Activates the current targeter, if one exists.  You should first
/// validate the targeter exists with `has_targeter()` and then
/// set a valid position with `check_targeter_position(x, y)`.
///
/// ## Examples
/// ```lua
/// if game:has_targeter() then
///   x = target:x()
///   y = target:y()
///   if game:check_targeter_position(x, y) then
///     game:activate_targeter()
///   end
/// end
/// ```
///
/// # `cancel_targeter()`
/// Deactivates the current targeter.  Throws an error if there is no
/// active targeter.  You should verify a targeter is active with `has_targeter()`
/// before calling this method.
///
/// # `check_targeter_position(x: Int, y: Int) -> bool`
/// Sets the selected coordinates for the targeter and then checks if
/// the position is valid to activate.  See also `activate_targeter()`
///
/// # `get_targeter_affected() -> ScriptEntitySet`
/// Returns the set of entities currently affected by the active targeter,
/// if there is one.  If there is no active targeter, throws an error.  You
/// should verify a targeter is active with `has_targeter()` before calling
/// this method.
///
/// # `has_targeter() -> Bool`
/// Returns true if a targeter is currently active, false otherwise.
/// Useful for AI activating of abilities.
///
/// # `cancel_blocking_anims()`
/// Cancels all current blocking animations on all entities.  Blocking animations
/// are those that normally cause the player to wait for their completion before
/// performing another action.  This includes movement, attacks, and most
/// fixed duration particle effects.
///
/// # `check_ai_activation(entity: ScriptEntity)`
/// Checks all entities for ai activation - i.e. if they can see a hostile,
/// they become AI active.  This can trigger the start of combat.  Useful
/// when a script updates the state of the area in such a way that combat
/// might start (such as unhiding an entity or spawning an encounter).  This
/// is not needed when scripts cause movement, as it is called automatically
/// in those cases.  The entity should be the one whose state has changed.
///
/// # `fade_out_in()`
/// Causes the main view to fade out, then back in again.  This duration of the
/// fades is defined in the theme for the `WindowFade` widget.
///
/// # `init_party_day()`
/// Starts a new day for the player character and party.  This resets all skill
/// uses and sets maximum hit points.  This is normally used in a script when the
/// party rests.
///
/// # `create_menu(title: String, callback: CallbackData)`
/// Creates a new `ScriptMenu` which can then be built up and finally shown with `show()`.
/// Calls the callback function `on_menu_select` when the user select an option.
///
/// # `show_confirm(message: String, accept: String, cancel: String,
/// id: String, func: String)`
/// Shows a simple confirmation dialog with the specified `message`, and specified text
/// on the `accept` and `cancel` buttons.  If the user cancels, no action is taken.  If the
/// user accepts, the specified `func` is called from the script with `id`.
///
/// # `warn(message: String)`
/// Logs the specified string to the game's output at warn level.
///
/// # `log(message: String)`
/// Logs the specified string to the game's output at info level.  This is primarily useful
/// for debugging purposes.
///
/// # `ap_display_factor() -> Int`
/// Gets the ap display factor, which is the factor that the internal AP representation is
/// divided by when displayed.  Any AP values that are displayed to the user must be
/// divided by this factor.
///
/// # `anim_base_time() -> Float`
/// Returns the animation base time, which affects how long animations last.  Generally,
/// animations should multiply some base time by this factor when determining the duration
/// of animations.  This value is user configurable in the options menu.
///
/// # `atan2(x: Float, y: Float) -> Float`
/// Computes the four quadrant arctan function.  See `f32::atan2`
///
/// # `block_ui(time: Float)`
/// Locks the UI so the player cannot take any additional in game actions (such as movement
/// or combat) for the specified `time` number of seconds.
///
/// # `run_script_delayed(script_id: String, func: String, delay: Float)`
/// Causes the specified `func` from the script with `script_id` to be run after `delay`
/// seconds.  The script is actually run on the first frame after `delay` seconds have
/// elapsed.  The game can normally achieve a comfortable 60 fps on the vast majority of
/// hardware, but be aware that this is not always the case.
///
/// # `create_callback(parent: ScriptEntity, script: String) -> ScriptCallback`
/// Creates a new script callback.  This callback will utilize the specified script
/// file for all methods.  See `ScriptCallback` for more.
///
/// # `set_quest_state(quest: String, state: String)`
/// Sets the specified `quest` to the `state`.  `state` must be one of `Hidden`, `Visible`,
/// `Active`, or `Complete`.  `quest` must be the ID of a valid quest definition.
///
/// # `set_quest_entry_state(quest: String, entry: String, state: String)`
/// Sets the specified `entry` within the specified `quest` to `state`.  `state` must be one
/// of `Hidden`, `Visible, `Active`, or `Complete`.  `quest` must be the ID of a valid quest
/// definition, and `entry` must be an entry within that quest.
///
/// # `get_quest_state(quest: String) -> String`
/// Returns the current `state` of the specified `quest`.  `state` will be one of
/// `Hidden`, `Visible`, `Active`, or `Complete`.
///
/// # `get_quest_entry_state(quest: String, entry: String)`
/// Returns the current `state` of the specified `entry` in the given `quest`.
///
/// # `set_world_map_location_visible(location: String, visible: Bool)`
/// Sets the specified `location` in the world map to the specified `visible`.  The
/// location must be defined in the world_map section of the campaign definition file.
///
/// # `set_world_map_location_enabled(location: String, enabled: Bool)`
/// Sets the specified `location` in the world map `enabled`.  If disabled, a user
/// viewing the world map cannot travel to that location.  The location  must be defined
/// in the world_map section of the campaign definition file.
///
/// # `is_passable(entity: ScriptEntity, x: Int, y: Int) -> Bool`
/// Returns true if the specified coordinates in the current area are passable for
/// the entity, false otherwise.
///
/// # `spawn_actor_at(id: String, x: Int, y: Int, faction: String (Optional)) -> ScriptEntity`
/// Attempts the spawn an instance of the actor with the specified `id` at the
/// coordinates `x`, `y` in the current area.  If successful, returns the
/// ScriptEntity that was just spawned.  If not, returns the invalid ScriptEntity.
/// Optionally, you may set the faction of the spawned actor to the specified value.
/// Must be "Hostile", "Neutral", or "Friendly".  This method can fail if the
/// ID or coordinates are invalid, or if the location is not passable for the entity
///
/// # `spawn_encounter_at(x: Int, y: Int, area_id: String (Optional))`
/// Causes the encounter in the current area at `x`, `y` to spawn entities based
/// on its encounter definition.  If the entities are hostile and within player
/// visibility, will initiate combat.
///
/// # `enable_trigger_at(x: Int, y: Int, area_id: String (Optional))`
/// Sets the trigger in the current area at `x`, `y` to enabled.  This means the
/// trigger will fire when its condition (such as player entering its coordinates)
/// are met.  This method will only have an effect on triggers which are set to
/// be initially_disabled in their defintion, or which have been disabled via
/// `disable_trigger_at`.
///
/// # `disable_trigger_at(x: Int, y: Int, area_id: String(Optional))`
/// Sets the trigger in the current area at `x`, `y` to disabled.  This means the
/// trigger will not fire regardless of whether its condition is met.
///
/// # `enable_prop_at(x: Int, y: Int, area_id: String (Optional))`
/// Sets the prop in the current area at `x`, `y` to enabled.  When enabled, props
/// can be interacted with if relevant for the given prop (doors or containers).
///
/// # `disable_prop_at(x: Int, y: Int, area_id: String (Optional))`
/// Sets the prop in the current area at `x`, `y` to disabled.  When disabled, props
/// cannot be interacted with regardless of whether they otherwise are interactive.
///
/// # `toggle_prop_at(x: Int, y: Int, area_id: String (Optional))`
/// Toggles the enabled / disabled state of the prop at `x`, `y`.  See `enable_prop_at` and
/// `disable_prop_at`
///
/// # `say_line(line: String, target: ScriptEntity (Optional))`
/// The specified `target`, or the player if no target is specified, will say the line
/// of text specified by `line`.  This is represented by the text appearing on the main
/// area view overhead of the target entity.  The text fades away after several seconds.
///
/// # `start_conversation(id: String, target: ScriptEntity (Optional))`
/// Starts the conversation with the specified `id`, with the `target` or the player if the
/// target is not specified.  The conversation is defined in the conversation data file
/// for the relevant id.
///
/// # `show_game_over_window(text: String)`
/// Shows the game over window, indicating that the player cannot continue
/// in the current module without loading.  This can be used to show victory
/// or defeat.  The specified `text` is displayed.
///
/// # `load_module(id: String)`
/// Causes the module with the specified `id` to be loaded.  The player, their money,
/// items, and party stash are transfered to the module intact.  Player script state is
/// not currently transfered, and any other data in the current module is also not
/// transfered, including the player's party.  This action is performed asynchronously
/// on the next UI update, the remained of the current script will be executed.
///
/// # `player -> ScriptEntity`
/// Returns a reference to the player character ScriptEntity.
///
/// # `show_cutscene(id: String)`
/// Causes the cutscene with the specified `id` to show.  This blocks the user interface
/// until the cutscene is complete or the player skips it.  The cutscene is launched
/// asynchronously on the next frame, so the remaineder of this script script will execute
/// immediately.
///
/// # `scroll_view(x: Int, y: Int)`
/// Causes the view of the current area to scroll to the specified `x`, `y` coordinates.
/// This done using a smooth scroll effect.  The scroll begins on the next frame, so the
/// remainder of the current script will continue to execute immediately.
///
/// # `num_effects_with_tag(tag: String) -> Int`
/// Returns the number of currently active effects, in any area, with the specified effect
/// tag.  This can be used in scripts to enforce a global limit on a specific effect type.
///
/// # `has_party_member(id: String) -> Bool`
/// Returns true if one of the current party members has the specified `id`, false otherwise
///
/// # `add_party_member(id: String, show_portrait: Bool (Optional))`
/// Searches for an entity with the specified `id`.  If it is found, adds that entity as a
/// member of the player's party, making them controllable by the player.  If an entity with
/// the `id` is not found, throws an error.
/// `show_portrait` controls where the entity is displayed in the portraits area of the UI.  If
/// not passed, defaults to true.
///
/// # `remove_party_member(id: String)`
/// Removes the entity with the specified ID from the party, if it is currently in the party.
/// Does nothing otherwise.
///
/// # `party_coins() -> Int`
/// Returns the current amount of party coins.  Note that this value must be divided by the
/// item_value_display_factor in the module rules in order to get the displayed amount of
/// coins.
///
/// # `add_party_coins(amount: Int)`
/// Adds the specified number of coins to the party.  Note that this value is divided by
/// the item_value_display_factor to get the displayed coinage.
///
/// # `find_party_item(id: String, adjective: String (Optional, up to 3)) -> ScriptStashItem`
/// Returns a ScriptStashItem representing the first item in the party stash found
/// matching the specified ID and all specified `adjective`s.  If no such item is found,
/// returns an invalid ScriptStashItem.
///
/// # `remove_party_item(item: ScriptStashItem)`
/// Removes a quantity of one of the specified item from the party stash.
///
/// # `add_party_item(id: String, adjective: String (Optional, up to 3)) -> ScriptStashItem`
/// Creates an item with the specified `id`, and `adjective`, if specified.  If there is
/// no item definition with this ID or the adjective is specified but there is no
/// adjective with that ID, throws an error.  Otherwise, the item is added to the party
/// stash.  Returns a `ScriptStashItem` representing the added item.
///
/// # `add_party_xp(amount: Int)`
/// Adds the specified amount of XP to the party.  Each current party member is given
/// this amount of XP.
///
/// # `transition_party_to(x: Int, y: Int, area: String (Optional))`
/// Moves the party to the specified coordinates within the specified area.  If an area is not
/// specified, the transition occurs within the current area.  If the area
/// or coordinates are invalid, this will currently leave the game in a bad state where
/// the player is forced to load to continue.  The player is moved to the exact coordinates,
/// whereas other party members are moved to nearby coordinates.
